yah, yall need to do this. Try and take just daily or weekly pictures of all of the reefs on earth and just take note of the local wind and 
swell conditions


that will help everyon greatly when deciding to go on surf trips. 

you can do it for sandbars too. that way i can know when to go to the northern abacoas and know where to go to surf during all swell conditions.
